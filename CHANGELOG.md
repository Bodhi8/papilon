# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

### Added
- `papilon.MMM`: a Bayesian marketing mix model fit by gated importance sampling,
  following the inference path in RFC 001 (`papilon-amortized-inference-design.md`).
  - Geometric and delayed adstock, Hill saturation, positive channel effects.
  - Baseline, trend, yearly seasonality and controls integrated out in closed form.
  - An effective-sample-size gate that accepts, refines or escalates the proposal.
  - `compare_carryover()` to choose carryover shapes by Bayes factor.
  - `get_roi()`, `parameters()`, `contributions()`, `response_curve()` and
    `optimize_budget()`.
- `papilon.make_synthetic_mmm()`: weekly marketing data with a known ground truth.
- A test suite (`tests/`) and a quickstart example (`examples/mmm_quickstart.py`).

### Changed
- License changed from a proprietary license to the Apache License, Version 2.0.
- README rewritten to describe only released functionality; planned work moved
  to a Roadmap section.
- Package metadata fixed (version, license, classifiers, dependencies).

### Restored
- The 0.2.0 modules (entropy, energy, states, relationships, causal, simulation,
  optimizer, topology), which were published on PyPI but had been removed from
  the repository.

## 0.2.0 (2025-04-20)

- First public release on PyPI: entropy and energy measures, microstate counting,
  KDE scenario simulation, relationship analysis, a dependency screen
  (`infer_causal_structure`) and grid-search optimization.
